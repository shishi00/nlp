# Datasheet: *Dialogues From Popular TV Shows in 2000-2010*

Author: Thi Nguyen

Organization: INFO 159 


## Motivation

*The questions in this section are primarily intended to encourage dataset creators to clearly articulate their reasons for creating the dataset and to promote transparency about funding interests.*

1. **For what purpose was the dataset created?** Was there a specific task in mind? Was there a specific gap that needed to be filled? Please provide a description.

	The dataset was created to answer the question “How culturally sensitive pieces of dialogue from shows aired in 2000 to 2010 would be perceived in 2022 standards?" for our Annotation Project.


2. **Who created this dataset (e.g. which team, research group) and on behalf of which entity (e.g. company, institution, organization)**?

	My team (Jihee, Kaity, Thi) created this dataset for INFO 159 Annotation Project. 

3. **What support was needed to make this dataset?** (e.g. who funded the creation of the dataset? If there is an associated grant, provide the name of the grantor and the grant name and number, or if it was supported by a company or government agency, give those details.)

	N/A

4. **Any other comments?**

	N/A


## Composition

*Dataset creators should read through the questions in this section prior to any data collection and then provide answers once collection is complete. Most of these questions are intended to provide dataset consumers with the information they need to make informed decisions about using the dataset for specific tasks. The answers to some of these questions reveal information about compliance with the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) or comparable regulations in other jurisdictions.*

1. **What do the instances that comprise the dataset represent (e.g. documents, photos, people, countries)?** Are there multiple types of instances (e.g. movies, users, and ratings; people and interactions between them; nodes and edges)? Please provide a description.

	Each instance in the dataset represents a piece of dialogue from a character of one of the shows in our data. We define one piece of dialogue to be the entire string from when the character starts speaking to when the next character speaks.

2. **How many instances are there in total (of each type, if appropriate)?**

	There are a total of 1000 instances.

3. **Does the dataset contain all possible instances or is it a sample (not necessarily random) of instances from a larger set?** If the dataset is a sample, then what is the larger set? Is the sample representative of the larger set (e.g. geographic coverage)? If so, please describe how this representativeness was validated/verified. If it is not representative of the larger set, please describe why not (e.g. to cover a more diverse range of instances, because instances were withheld or unavailable).

	The data set is a random sample from a larger set. The larger set is the set of all dialogues from all the seasons/episodes in early 2000s - 2010 from the shows we selected. We randomly selected 250 pieces of dialogue from each of the four shows, from a minimum of 10 different episodes. It is hard to know whether the sample is representative of the larger set as we would have had to done annotation on the larger set to truly know, but since we took a random sample, we assumed that the sample is representative of the larger set.

4. **What data does each instance consist of?** "Raw" data (e.g. unprocessed text or images) or features? In either case, please provide a description.

	Each instance, before annotation, simply consists of a unique data ID and then the text/dialogue as a string. After annotation, there was also a label/score of 1-5 attached to each instance.

5. **Is there a label or target associated with each instance?** If so, please provide a description.

	The label/target of each instance is the score between 1-5 according to our guideline on how offensive they are.

6. **Is any information missing from individual instances?** If so, please provide a description, explaining why this information is missing (e.g. because it was unavailable). This does not include intentionally removed information, but might include, e.g. redacted text.

	No.

7. **Are relationships between individual instances made explicit (e.g. users' movie ratings, social network links)?** If so, please describe how these relationships are made explicit.

	No, relationships between individual instances (such as episode, season, show, etc) were not included in the data.

8. **Are there recommended data splits (e.g. training, development/validation, testing)?** If so, please provide a description of these splits, explaining the rationale behind them.

	Yes; the sample was randomly split into training (60%), development (20%), and test (20%). The split was provided by the INFO159 course staff.

9. **Are there any errors, sources of noise, or redundancies in the dataset?** If so, please provide a description.

	There may be redundancies in the dataset due to the nature of TV show scripts; some of the dialogues randomly chosen, especially ones that are shorter, may end up being the same or extremely similar (e.g. "Yes," "Thank you," etc) which would make annotation and model building inefficient.

10. **Is the dataset self-contained, or does it link to or otherwise rely on external resources (e.g. websites, tweets, other datasets)?** If it links to or relies on external resources, a) are there guarantees that they will exist, and remain constant, over time; b) are there official archival versions of the complete dataset (i.e., including the external resources as they existed at the time the dataset was created); c) are there any restrictions (e.g. licenses, fees) associated with any of the external resources that might apply to a future user? Please provide descriptions of all external resources and any restrictions associated with them, as well as links or other access points, as appropriate.

	The dataset relies on external websites from which we extracted the scripts. 

11. **Does the dataset contain data that might be considered confidential (e.g. data that is protected by legal privilege or by doctor-patient confidentiality, data that includes the content of individuals' non-public communications)?** If so, please provide a description.

	No.

12. **Does the dataset contain data that, if viewed directly, might be offensive, insulting, threatening, or might otherwise cause anxiety?** If so, please describe why.

	Yes, some of the dialogues in the data may contain offensive text, which was the point of project/annotation.

13. **Does the dataset relate to people?** If not, you may skip the remaining questions in this section.

	Yes -- each instance relates to a character in the show.

14. **Does the dataset identify any subpopulations (e.g. by age, gender)?** If so, please describe how these subpopulations are identified and provide a description of their respective distributions within the dataset.

	In the larger data set, it identifies subpopulations by the show.

15. **Is it possible to identify individuals (i.e., one or more natural persons), either directly or indirectly (i.e., in combination with other data) from the dataset?** If so, please describe how.

	Yes, it would be possible to identify the individual since the larger dataset contains information about which show and which character the dialogue is from.

16. **Does the dataset contain data that might be considered sensitive in any way (e.g. data that reveals racial or ethnic origins, sexual orientations, religious beliefs, political opinions or union memberships, or locations; financial or health data; biometric or genetic data; forms of government identification, such as social security numbers; criminal history)?** If so, please provide a description.

	Information about which character the dialogue is from may reveal further information about their demographic through the character, but not the actual individual playing the character.

17. **Any other comments?**

	No.


## Collection

*As with the previous section, dataset creators should read through these questions prior to any data collection to flag potential issues and then provide answers once collection is complete. In addition to the goals of the prior section, the answers to questions here may provide information that allow others to reconstruct the dataset without access to it.*

1. **How was the data associated with each instance acquired?** Was the data directly observable (e.g. raw text, movie ratings), reported by subjects (e.g. survey responses), or indirectly inferred/derived from other data (e.g. part-of-speech tags, model-based guesses for age or language)? If data was reported by subjects or indirectly inferred/derived from other data, was the data validated/verified? If so, please describe how.

	The data was directly observable. It was raw text, which consisted of dialogues from 4 different TV shows (House MD, The Big Bang Theory, The Simpson, and Friends). The data was from Kaggle, then combined and filtered based on the TV shows' season released dates.

2. **What mechanisms or procedures were used to collect the data (e.g. hardware apparatus or sensor, manual human curation, software program, software API)?** How were these mechanisms or procedures validated?

	N/A

3. **If the dataset is a sample from a larger set, what was the sampling strategy (e.g. deterministic, probabilistic with specific sampling probabilities)?**

	The dataset consisted of 1000 datapoints, which were randomly chosen. 

4. **Who was involved in the data collection process (e.g. students, crowdworkers, contractors) and how were they compensated (e.g. how much were crowdworkers paid)?**

	N/A

5. **Over what timeframe was the data collected?** Does this timeframe match the creation timeframe of the data associated with the instances (e.g. recent crawl of old news articles)? If not, please describe the timeframe in which the data associated with the instances was created. Finally, list when the dataset was first published.

	March 2022

7. **Were any ethical review processes conducted (e.g. by an institutional review board)?** If so, please provide a description of these review processes, including the outcomes, as well as a link or other access point to any supporting documentation.

	N/A

8. **Does the dataset relate to people?** If not, you may skip the remainder of the questions in this section.

	Yes, the dataset were dialogues. 

9. **Did you collect the data from the individuals in question directly, or obtain it via third parties or other sources (e.g. websites)?**

	We collected the data via a third party (Kaggle). 

10. **Were the individuals in question notified about the data collection?** If so, please describe (or show with screenshots or other information) how notice was provided, and provide a link or other access point to, or otherwise reproduce, the exact language of the notification itself.

	No, the dataset was publicly available. They were dialogues from TV shows.

11. **Did the individuals in question consent to the collection and use of their data?** If so, please describe (or show with screenshots or other information) how consent was requested and provided, and provide a link or other access point to, or otherwise reproduce, the exact language to which the individuals consented.

	Yes, the individuals (actors, actresses, writers, etc.) consented by publishing their work.

12. **If consent was obtained, were the consenting individuals provided with a mechanism to revoke their consent in the future or for certain uses?** If so, please provide a description, as well as a link or other access point to the mechanism (if appropriate).

	Yes, the consenting individuals could revoke their consent by requesting to remove their work in the future.

13. **Has an analysis of the potential impact of the dataset and its use on data subjects (e.g. a data protection impact analysis) been conducted?** If so, please provide a description of this analysis, including the outcomes, as well as a link or other access point to any supporting documentation.

	No.

14. **Any other comments?**

	N/A


## Preprocessing / Cleaning / Labeling

*Dataset creators should read through these questions prior to any pre-processing, cleaning, or labeling and then provide answers once these tasks are complete. The questions in this section are intended to provide dataset consumers with the information they need to determine whether the “raw” data has been processed in ways that are compatible with their chosen tasks. For example, text that has been converted into a “bag-of-words” is not suitable for tasks involving word order.*

1. **Was any preprocessing/cleaning/labeling of the data done (e.g. discretization or bucketing, tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, SIFT feature extraction, removal of instances, processing of missing values)?** If so, please provide a description. If not, you may skip the remainder of the questions in this section.

	Yes. Preprocessing and labeling done on the data include:
	- Labeling by team members based on a scale of 1-5, with the third member acting as the adjudicator
	- Sum and average of AFINN dictionary scores: after finding AFINN scores of every word in the text, take the sum or average
	- Number of stop words: number of stop words in text from NLTK stopwords package
	- Number of characters, word, unique words
	- Proportion of unique and stop words: number of unique words or stop words divided by number of words in each text
	- Number of “bad” words: number of words in text that appear in the [list of “bad words” curated by research group at CMU] (https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~biglou/resources/bad-words.txt)

2. **Was the "raw" data saved in addition to the preprocessed/cleaned/labeled data (e.g. to support unanticipated future uses)?** If so, please provide a link or other access point to the "raw" data.

	Yes, the "raw" data was saved separately:
	- [train] (https://github.com/shishi00/nlp/blob/main/train.txt)
	- [dev] (https://github.com/shishi00/nlp/blob/main/dev.txt)
	- [test] (https://github.com/shishi00/nlp/blob/main/test.txt)

3. **Is the software used to preprocess/clean/label the instances available?** If so, please provide a link or other access point.

	We used a Jupyter notebook to clean, label, and preprocess the data. The notebook is not publicly available, but has been submitted to INFO159 course staff.

4. **Any other comments?**

	No.


## Uses

*These questions are intended to encourage dataset creators to reflect on the tasks  for  which  the  dataset  should  and  should  not  be  used.  By  explicitly highlighting these tasks, dataset creators can help dataset consumers to make informed decisions, thereby avoiding potential risks or harms.*

1. **Has the dataset been used for any tasks already?** If so, please provide a description.

	Yes, the dataset has been used to answer the question “How culturally sensitive pieces of dialogue from shows aired in 2000 to 2010 would be perceived in 2022 standards?”. It was used to build NLP models to classify the dialogues into labels from 1 to 5. A score of 1 corresponds to the little to no insensitivity, and a score of 5 corresponds to extremely “cancellable.” 

2. **Is there a repository that links to any or all papers or systems that use the dataset?** If so, please provide a link or other access point.

	No.

3. **What (other) tasks could the dataset be used for?**

	The dataset could be used for question-answering tasks, such as generating jokes, or conversations.

4. **Is there anything about the composition of the dataset or the way it was collected and preprocessed/cleaned/labeled that might impact future uses?** For example, is there anything that a future user might need to know to avoid uses that could result in unfair treatment of individuals or groups (e.g. stereotyping, quality of service issues) or other undesirable harms (e.g. financial harms, legal risks) If so, please provide a description. Is there anything a future user could do to mitigate these undesirable harms?

	No.
	
5. **Are there tasks for which the dataset should not be used?** If so, please provide a description.

	No.

6. **Any other comments?**

	No.
