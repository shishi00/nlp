0853	1	I'm going to ask a lot of questions that all have sort of positive answers.
0837	1	Come on, Sheldon, this is important to me.
0281	1	I will tell. I will tell the mediator. What-what are you... Ok. Oh, was that in the way? Get rid of it.
0576	1	Hello. Oh, hi. Yeah, hold on a second. I'll get him. Sheldon, it's for you.
0209	1	The papers could have been mailed, Mom just sent you here to spy on me, didn't she.
0610	2	JELLO shots and wild sex, what else?
0933	1	Okay.
0726	1	So dying liver released toxins, damaged the nerves, led to locked-in syndrome.
0048	1	This is so huge.
0986	1	I'm not asking you to go on a date with him!
0338	1	The apartment. Leonard is dressed smartly and placing wine on the table. Sheldon enters.
0582	1	Paraneoplastic syndrome's out. The lung donor didn't have cancer.
0156	1	Ooh, oh no! I have to go! I have a massage appointment.
0693	1	I'm not okay.
0863	1	You should actually thank Erin, she's the one who agreed to babysit.
0791	1	Lee. You with me now? Easy questions. You'll be done before you know it. Is this equation correct?
0573	1	Y'know I would it's just painful.
0242	2	Oh, I'm sorry. Did I break your concentration? Please continue. You were talking about personal privacy. [The boy at the table is obviously scared speechless.] What, you're finished? Well, allow me to retort. [House aims the gun right at him…]
0993	1	This all sounds great to me. But I could see how some people might think that they're bad. I don't know what to think.
0789	1	I'm funny? Oh thank God! Well hey, I've got a ton of these! Umm, oh hear—Do you want a good one? Here's a good one. Umm, you uh, you take a quarter, take a quarter and, and you blacken the edge. Right? (Does so.) And then you say to person, I bet you can't roll this quarter from your forehead to your chin without it leaving your face. And then when they do it, they're left with a big black pencil line right down the center of their face.
0981	1	(entering) Hey uh Monica, I can't remember. Did we say we were gonna meet here or at the movies?
0499	1	In Penny's bed.
0108	1	She has massive internal bleeding.
0768	1	made a sale.
0840	1	Ahh, wait, is Wendy the runner-up Miss Oklahoma?
0932	1	Bobby is an incredibly fun, great guy. Just not a great influence.
0301	1	Exactly. The ghost is a hallucination, which is the result of a delusion which most likely is the result of a hereditary disease that her mother died from when the patient was four.
0387	1	Damn!
0491	1	Damn it! Rookie mistake!
0919	1	Don't bother. He's dead.
0050	1	No, (waves her away) You were saying, butâ€¦
0217	1	Well, this is what happens when people live on the edge!
0888	1	Good morning Rachel.
0074	1	When Deangelo's around.
0126	1	Oh.. man..
0566	1	No, no. You may be right about me and Leonard.
0263	1	Yeah, I assume I'm not driving anywhere tonight. (Sheldon lets out a loud noise).
0718	1	Oh does it matter?! All that matters is that you look so handsome.
0597	1	And you can tell that from the vast amount of information you've gleaned from not being here?
0670	1	Gee, why wouldn't I?
0310	1	You didn't. I quit. [She finishes and rolls his sleeve down.]
0804	1	That depends.
0878	2	But we'll have sex first, right?
0849	1	I guessed premature. Does that count?
0581	1	Uh-huh.
0865	1	If we do any more imaging, we're gonna have to add radiation poisoning to the DDX.
0448	2	Behind what? Oh, yeah, your — grabbed your tushy. So now you're pretending to be on call so that your overly protective boyfriend won't find out that you got groped.
0485	1	How're you doing?
0419	1	House... you're kidding, right? I've done my due diligence. She's the best there is.
0148	1	He played poker. Who plays poker without cigars? Even if he didn't light up himself… It was a rainy night. The windows were closed.
0557	1	Leonard, I don't know what to tell you. It was just a hug.
0324	1	I have spent a year here. I have to commit or get out. Dwight's the top salesman in the company and he's taking me on my first sales call today. And, um, I'm excited.
0038	1	Where's the new bracelet?
0587	1	The comic book store.
0439	1	 Cancer's boring.
0410	1	You're Bonnie's friend. You know how to reach her. And yet instead of calling her, you come and seek my permission. You want my blessing, and implicitly, House's blessing.
0053	1	It's just food. Something small enough to go down the wrong pipe, too big to get washed out by the bronchial lavage.
0600	1	I'm going to numb up the area where we'll go in for the punch biopsy.
0688	1	Your guy Eddie Crispo?
0880	1	Give me the eraser.
0717	1	Yeah, so you found someone for me. You didn't forget?
0244	1	(Into the phone) Hello? Chandler, what's wrong? (She listens) Oh my God, are you alright? (listens some more) Yeah, I'll be right there. (She hangs up and speaks to Amanda) I'm so sorry, but Chandler was in a car accident. (She gets up)
0132	3	Only obsession is with the idiots in the right-here-and-now life who think there's an afterlife.
0563	1	Yeah, that's good.
0220	1	He's good at his job. And I like working for him.
0096	1	je.
0809	1	You're not gonna leave the kid?
0083	1	re, if you are.
0697	1	I have a very important announcement to make... about... your paychecks. Umm... Your paychecks will be arriving as scheduled on Friday. And they will be in the correct amount that they are normally in... Please stand by for a very important announcement... refer.. for further regarding your paycheck!
0307	1	Ok, now, is there anything I can do to... you know, butter him up? Anything he really likes?
0957	1	How so?
0145	1	No, it's lettuce.
1000	1	Okay. Goodnight Sheldon.
0416	1	Whose side are you on, senator? First respect his wishes, then invade Iraq, then get the troops home. Make up your mind.
0549	1	Andy? I think we should acknowledge the man who has led us to such a profitable quarter. To Robert California.
0005	1	Here we go.
0705	3	Actually, in India, the names of constellations are different. Where you have the Big Dipper, we have the Big Curry Pot.
0708	1	Okay, well, thanks for sharing with us. Good night.
0144	2	I'm not bargaining sex for babysitting. Besides, you owe me.
0270	1	Wow! I can't believe you lied to me.
0927	1	Oh great.
0480	1	Probably not. Postmortem, we were able to harvest all of her blood. It's enough to treat the baby.
0285	1	It's time.
0890	1	No, I just mean that, you know, first impressions don't mean anything. And I-I think you're a really good guy and I'm sorry that I misjudged you.
0952	1	Turns out toilets are handy in this situation. And I felt relatively sure that Cuddy wouldn't come in.
0295	1	Okay. Okay. (Exits and Phoebe checks him out.)
0951	1	All right, try pedaling.
0014	1	Smells pretty bad, doesn't it?
0706	1	Why not?
0516	1	Yeah! Thank you so much for letting me stay here.
0752	2	No problem, I'm very skilled at postponing intercourse. So I guess I'll call you and we'll arrange another evening.
0357	1	Your brain doesn't remember, it was just a few seconds.
0122	1	I did not throw it, I placed it, knowing that the janitor would find it and know it was yours and return it to you unharmed. I'm a moron. But that doesn't mean I-I don't care about you, that I don't think about you, that I don't want you to be happy. I was wrong. You were right. I can do better. Just… give me a chance.
0622	1	I'm not sure that I do. Um, is that one thirty-six hour experience, or is it thirty six hours spread out over say, oneâ€¦ glorious summer.
0910	1	(looks at him suspiciously) I know what this is all about... You've always been jealous of my hair.
0896	1	350 and one penny.
0984	1	My parents used to scramble to find babysitters so they could take my younger brother to do stuff. I understand how hard it can be. I just-tonight, if you could...
0473	5	You wanna be Bosley? Bosley's like the asexual messenger boy.
0478	1	Get the damn phone.
0864	1	..."C-SPAN"?
0956	1	Phillip, if you're hearing this memo, that can only mean one thing, I'm dead. You are the rightful heir to Schrute Farms. Please, you must do one thing. Kill Mose before he kills you. Mose, hey, it's Dwight. Listen, yeah, I just want to give you a heads-up.
0296	1	No! No, that you and Rachel are engaged!
0730	1	Counting this instance? 317.
0379	1	He's seen all the tests we've seen. Even if we figure out what was causing the lung damage, it's too late to reverse it.
0642	1	Carol used to drink lattes.
0754	1	Wow. I don't see how we missed that.
0059	1	Get your finger off my phone.
0799	1	He’s not asking you to help him kill himself; he’s just asking for help. The disease will kill him.
0372	1	When you thought Joey proposed did…did you say yes?
0272	1	So, what did House want earlier?
0975	2	All that singing got in the way of some perfectly good murders.
0170	1	Six Weeks Earlier
0240	1	Somebody defaced the billboards we just put out in an inappropriate way.
0208	1	Do you mind crouching down a little bit, so that I look taller? (Chandler does so) There you go. (And they walk down the red carpet.)
0359	1	I got the transfer papers. Plasmapheresis is all set up. Are you okay? [She touches the bruise on House’s cheek.]
0875	1	These instructions are a pictographic representation of the least imaginative way to assemble these components. This right here is why Sweden has no space program.
0601	1	Just give us a minute.
0510	1	Hey-hey, Pheebs, check it out, we already learned a song. (To Rachel) Ready? One, two, three, four...
0435	3	Thirteen and Cutthroat Bitch had a disagreement, and the cafeteria was out of jell-o.
0586	1	More to the point, it's about finding a way to keep Leonard and Stephanie together.
0035	1	Nothing! You have apologized to her like a million times and she's been nothing but terrible to you. And don't forget you just threw her daughter a lovely, albeit slightly boring, shower, and she hasn't even thanked you for it.
0635	1	What was I supposed to tell her?
0434	1	Uh, yes.
0312	1	Oh, just so you know, you-you have to let him win.
0702	1	Yes, well I'm not a child, I'm a grown man capable of living my life as I see fit. And I certainly don't need someone telling on me to my mother.
0476	1	Oh, I love San Francisco. I wish I was going with you.
0332	2	That's what the morons at the Rutgers Student Medical Center thought, which may be part of the reason he just coughed up a lung.
0474	1	(on the screen there's the word "Supermarket") Uhm... ok. It's a store, like a supermarket. (there is a sound indicating he made a mistake as he shouldn't have said 'supermarket'. The next word appears, "notebook") Oh! I see-I see what I did. Yeah, ok, ok, uhm... I'm writing in my...
0616	1	No, no, no! You kneed me in my misters!
0008	1	Not without the results of the LP.
0422	1	No.
0267	1	Don't worry! Don't worry. I just told him, very nicely, "You don't go buying people's babies, so back off!!"
0057	4	I'm guessing she's... what's the medical term? Upset. These 25-year-old females are usually completely rational. They're rocks. Really. [glances at the file momentarily] Eh... my theory seems to be supported by the fact that she swallowed a bottle of sleeping pills. Get her a shrink. And I need some shut-eye.
0385	1	That's my boy. I know the perfect place, too.
0184	1	My father used to borrow it.
0392	3	Oh my! That's awfully sticky. Alright, let's see. Bernie Bunny has Two Daddies Now. It's probably about homosexual rabbits. Jerry the Gerbil and the Bullies on the Bus. Read it, not helpful. Oh! Here we go. Stu the Cockatoo is New at the Zoo. Author Sarah Carpenter lives in Fort Wayne, Indiana, with her husband and best friend Mark, and their cockatoos too. Hardly makes her an expert in making friends, wouldn't you agree?
0872	1	Phoebe come here
0201	1	None.
0101	1	Hand me the 10% KOH.
0060	1	Ah, good, Penny, you're here to exchange gifts. You'll be pleased to know I'm prepared for whatever you have to offer.
0495	1	Yeah.
0895	1	No! I made it seem like I was just calling to chat. Pretty sure, they both think I'm interested in them.
0147	1	Yes you can!
0686	1	u are hereby served with a summons to appear in Lackawanna county court.
0397	1	Well, then that was wrong of us. We need to widen our circle.
0894	1	Damn!
0317	1	What?
0177	1	I fell on the floor. All right, he got you, you can get him back.
0181	1	Nothin'.
0835	1	(pointing at Ross) Okay but if you don't find him and bring him back, I am gonna hunt you down and kick your ass!
0767	1	(calling from the bar on her cell phone.) Hey, Mike, it's me. Listen, is um, is Ross near you?
0020	2	Send it to the frickin' moon, idiot.
0807	1	Doctor appointment, car trouble, plantar warts, granddad fought in World War II. Use your head, man. I keep mine in here. Look alive, Halpert. Welcome back.
0069	1	Hoo-ah. Next patient on deck.
0796	1	Oh, I'm sorry, I don't have his phone number.
0454	1	Three months. This is gonna be great!
0232	1	Just when I think I've gotten the hang of sarcasm.
0617	1	Hey Pheebs?
0054	1	I didn't. Let's go.
0247	1	Oh, thank you. Well if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna go get myself a drink. Be back in a moment. (Walks away.)
0914	1	I think a birthday party is a terrible idea. I envy Leonard for growing up without that anguish.
0710	1	I could do that.
0815	1	You want me to reset the alarm?
0024	2	Oh God no, I don't wanna see him take his clothes off!
0337	1	Jim? Tell them what it's called.
0571	5	Bros before hos. Why? Because your bros are always there for you. They have got your back after your ho rips your heart out for no good reason. And you were nothing but great to your ho and you told her she was the only ho for you. And that she was better than all the other hos in the world. And then ... and then suddenly she's not yo' ho no mo'.
0812	1	So you're a little older. Try to look at the positive: You have all this life experience.
0482	1	The arrest means the demyelination hit the area in his brainstem that controls heart rhythm. We need answers fast, ‘cause this is going to happen again.
0114	1	Do you drink?
0169	1	Okay, here I go.
0763	1	What?
0363	1	So, how did it go with Lesley?
0698	2	Is it that time of year again? He's a self-important jerk.
0731	1	No matter how many times I reach out to Dwight, he doesn't seem to want anything to do with me. It reminds me of my relationship with my son. Except there, I'm the Dwight.
0544	1	It could be better! He, uhm... he fell asleep!
0026	2	No, Anthropology. We don't have this in that size, pretty lame.
0290	1	hoking] Wow. Oh, wow, that was close.
0198	1	Dwight, what's your take?
0012	1	I just need some time alone.
0989	4	What are you talking about? Bitch.
0629	1	Gotcha.
0234	1	(shaking his head disbelievingly) Dude!
0735	1	No, I saw you, and you were the only one.
0656	1	Well, I'm not proud of it, but, you know… sometimes when I was living on the street and I needed money for food and stuff I
0243	1	You told me it's mind-blowing, so, my mind is going into it pre-blown. And once a mind is pre-blown, it cannot be re-blown.
0277	1	Because he's my son. The doctor is the boy's mother.
0078	1	Please know that we are trulyâ€¦
0917	1	Someone who works with someone who thinks it's okay to break into other people's homes?
0699	1	Haha, what?
0445	1	you like her?
0595	1	What if the poison ivy wasn't poison ivy. She got the rash that was diagnosed as poison ivy around the same time the insomnia started. Rash plus nosebleed, plus sleep disturbance equals Wegener's Granulomatosis. Start corticosteroid treatment.
0068	1	I'm sorry," L"?
0090	1	Oh, good, that was an unusual interaction. I wasn't sure.
0394	1	There's a dog in the car.
0155	1	Phoebe, I love you. I mean, I missed you so much these last few months and I thought we were apart for a good reason, but then I suddenly realized that there was no reason good enough to keep me from spending the rest of my life with you.
0674	1	No.
0418	1	Oh, she could have the best pre-frontal cortex in the history of mankind, but given the choice of life versus death, those bad bad people are going to choose life.
0300	1	Mm-hmm. (To herself) Throw me a bone here.Scene: Central Perk, Rachel is on the couch as Ross enters.]
0727	1	Four dozen?
0200	1	How's it going over here, guys?
0511	1	Thank you, Penny Blossoms. These will be perfect to cover my bald spot. Aww, that is so sweet.
0040	1	Stop being an idiot.
0207	1	No, it's just not always a good idea for doctors to treat their friends, that's all.
0531	1	I put some guys on tonight. Best of your bunch and my bunch. Tell you now though, it's gonna be mostly my bunch.
0944	1	Well, how about one of our classic father/son duets?
0447	1	You can't ask the person she's about to dump to donate half her liver!
0483	1	(not getting it) Yeah! Yeah! Rachel picked it out for me. She told me to trust her and you know what? I'm glad I did! I turned quite a few heads on my way over here.
0526	1	The Mars Rover control room.
0769	1	That's a tablecloth.
0636	1	You chose this job over that job?
0268	1	Ok.
0371	1	ally? You told on me. That's lame.
0916	1	No. You're wrong.
0679	1	Bye Pam.
0838	1	I would spend a lot of time launching my true crime podcast, The Flenderson Files. Dum bum buh. Flenderson files.
0968	1	I was wrong. I went to prison. I paid the price. (Wilson’s pager beeps)
0560	1	Yeah—Ooh! Earrings! (Goes into her room.)
0843	1	What's with the blanket?
0569	1	He's selling the Sword of Azeroth on ebay.
0294	1	Leonard moves the meeting not occur. Is there a second? None heard, the motion fails. I'd like to begin the meeting by congratulating you on the progress in your relationship with Dr. Stephanie.
0879	1	What are you saying?
0110	1	Thank you.
0149	1	Will you all excuse me? Leonard is subtly signalling that he'd like to talk to me in private.
0100	1	I found a mole under the nail on her left index finger. The biopsy revealed it's melanoma.
0382	1	You have to tell me now.
0346	1	I'm proud of you.
0135	1	First off, that is axiomatically wrong, because the best pudding is chocolate. Secondly, the organic structure of tapioca makes it a jiggling bowl of potential death. It is extracted from the plantâ€¦
0545	1	All right, stop! You know, all Phoebe has done tonight is trying to get you to like her. And maybe that hasn't been clear all the time, but she did her best. And yeah... She's a little different than you are...
0245	1	s a deal.
0136	1	Are you one of Ben's mothers?
0591	1	It's a wrong answer.
0159	1	Yeah, I do like the one where Lois Lane falls from the helicopter and Superman swooshes down and catches her, which one was that?
0460	1	Don't you think if a woman was living with me I'd be the first one to know about it?
0369	1	Yeah.
0839	1	Oh that's terrible. I'm-I'm really sorry.
0885	1	dn't we? I think we did.
0367	1	Hi.
0406	1	House, the thing is perfectly round.
0947	1	Then I think you should fire me.
0426	1	Okay then, I don't stink. I'm a good chef. Okay. (Starts to leave.)
0928	1	(sexily) Hi officer, was I going a little too fast?
0912	1	You knew, and - you gave up half your liver anyway?
0866	1	Mister Wolowitz. Boys, I've got a question for you. Who in this room discovered a star?
0942	1	Oh, yeah, I'm a waitress at the Cheesecake Factory.
0051	1	When the cancer starts getting really bad…
0344	1	Yeah, you know, the dark sciences.
0187	1	I don't own House's cases. You had just as much right as I did to write it up. You should have told me, but, I should have handled it better too.
0816	1	Pump it up! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Pump up the volume. Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you, Mr. Springsteen. And welcome to C.R.I.M.E.-A.I.D. Crime Reduces Innocence Makes Everyone Angry I Declare. It is not known how many office robberies occur every second because there is no Wikipedia entry for office robbery statistics. However, tonight, its victims, are standing together and standing strong in the form of song, cooking lessons, and hugs. Really Phyllis? You're auctioning a hug? Okay, so with no further ado, lights, camera, auction! Take it away Bruce!
0785	1	Well, we broke into groups and the groups are doing presentations later.
0530	1	I was myself… for the most part. [He seems to consider if he should say anything else.] I know you're still upset, so I'm gonna… I'll leave you to — [He gets up and heads for the door.] to deal with it however you want.
0185	1	Good night.
0643	4	If she wants to be an idiot, it's her call. You don't need me. Have one of your team walk her through the process.
0479	1	I hope it's you.
0339	1	I don't think so.
0255	1	Okay, bye-bye.
0818	1	I got the surgery, what else is there to do?
0286	1	This Thanksgiving kicks last Thanksgiving's ass!
0678	1	The university cafeteria.
0778	1	David, can you help me?! I'm trying to explain to Chandler how a plane stays in the air.
0830	1	Either the mom's blood is special, which would mean it's treating something specific, which means the baby has a disease... Or mom's blood is just blood, and it's replacing something the baby is missing, which means the baby has a simple deficiency.
0551	1	Yeah, honey, you'll be fine as long as you don't do that bungee cord thing, okay?
0876	1	Black case, top compartment.
0825	1	Uh, we stars just try to eat right and get lots of exercise.
0983	1	Tuna, right? And this must be your lovely wife Pam .
0180	1	How would you like it if we booed you?
0750	1	Then it is no longer a dumpling, once you cut it open it is at best a very small open faced sandwich.
0227	1	Yeah.
0929	1	Phoebe is gonna be Monica's maid of honor!
0001	1	Huh. Wow, this is great.
0634	1	Oh. (He takes the picture and hugs her.
0358	1	I'll take five.
0258	1	Umm, two hundred and one dollars.
0224	1	The university lunch room.
0494	1	Hi! (He hands her, her mail) Thanks, hey so uh what'd you do last night?
0538	1	No! No! I can't! You gotta get me out of it! I've got plans! (Spits.) Important plans! (Spits on the Ps.)
0411	1	Oh, good. Wasn't sure it was coming across.
0696	1	What I'm trying to say is that, maybe you can't approach this as a purely intellectual exercise.
0070	1	Then I believe we've arrived at another quintessential rock-paper-scissors- lizard-Spock moment.
0973	1	Is everything all right?
0907	1	David is going to propose to Phoebe tonight!
0007	1	Okay, and this one is, "Huh. Don't see too many museums around here."
0661	1	Alright, I don't care what you say, I'm going to the conference and I'm presenting our findings.
0667	1	Oh, now I'm gonna throw up.
0056	1	Me too!
0701	1	I want you to care about more than just what you want, what you think. You need me, House. And you may even love me. But you don't care about me. And I deserve someone who does.
0381	1	What? (Glances over and sees the faces of the rest of the group, then goes and sits down.)
0351	1	Hey, Sheldon.
0632	1	Very funny, Jim.
0063	1	, you don't.
0216	4	Fine. Out of the goodness of my heart, which will make you happy, which will make you desire me more, which will turn into more sex.
0535	1	I assume House's money is on cancer.
0183	1	Awesome. Mine says, To my friend, Howard, from Stan Lee, Excelsior!
0488	1	(speaking as in pain) They're never coming down now.
0654	1	You know what, it's, it's better this way anyway. I mean I don't know what I was thinking, going down that road again with us. It's just much easier if we're just friends who have a kid.
0743	1	Pathetic. The first thing you said to me was you don't want your old environment. The fourth thing you said was, "where's my old environment?" It's been a year, Taub, Chase, Thirteen all moved on. The world does that sometimes.
0361	1	Ross's parents are my parents!
0877	1	YEAH!
0140	1	Hey, where do I park?
0709	1	Call a code.
0452	1	Howard, come on, I didn't plan on this. These things just happen. Usually not to me, but they do happen.
0076	1	He isn't dying anymore. Found out he was on a popcorn diet. Eating ten bags of microwave popcorn a day. Huffing the fumes scarred his lungs.
0146	1	I've outlined the exact parameters in an email, so check your spam folders, but basically you do your job better, you get points. So, collect fifteen points and redeem them for this polar bear.
0420	1	I can. I choose not to.
0700	1	Dr Gablehouser.
0707	1	That's pretty good. What about uh, for a thousand points?
0125	4	You make me want to kill myself.
0016	1	Yes.
0884	1	Not really. You were going to basically perjure yourself so that I could delay jail time. Doesn't it make more sense to actually perjure yourself so that I can actually avoid jail time?
0475	1	Oscar. Enough with the sass, please. God! What is wrong with you? Andy, listen to me. Look me in the eye. I thought that you were awesome.
0631	1	Yeah, I don't know.
0413	1	I'll take "You crossed the line".
0098	1	Oh, thank you.
0974	1	Goodnight!
0395	1	Uh, I actually haven't even met him.
0498	1	I assume, since you're calling so early, that the surgery was a rousing success.
0128	1	Yeah, we're trying to get pregnant.
0143	1	Yeah, I'm out.
0152	1	It was not a half hour. It was ten minutes. And he made copies of the ER records first.
0870	1	I-I can't go in there. I can't tell him!
0210	1	I'm actually the office manager.
0614	1	Ross I'm so sorry. Okay. I-I will promise I will straighten this out with him tomorrow in person, or via e-mail.
0308	1	Really?
0455	1	Okay. I'll let you get back to fixing your eggs.
0062	1	That's because you didn't bring a jacket.
0109	1	well, my new bed got delivered, if you come over and put it together, you can stay at my place.
0528	4	Everybody knows genetic diversity produces the strongest offspring. Why not put a little mocha in the family latte.
0319	1	How?
0496	1	Okay, I got a box, but there's no key in here. Just letters.
0826	1	How much memory does it have without the booster?
0167	1	Leonard, don't you get it? If you guys keep going along with his insanity, you're just encouraging him.
0378	1	Wow! This is very flattering, uh...
0423	1	So?
0908	1	Interesting subject matter. I'm surprised you pulled it off.
0196	1	That wasn't a no.
0925	1	We’re doctors: We treat patients, we don’t kill them.
0949	1	Well, last time you bought a new shirt was when we were dating.
0655	1	I need an aspirin.
0871	1	No..we don't
0782	1	I have a ring.
0540	1	They did not. They didn't have to say it to your face.
0653	1	Different school of thought. Let's just agree to disagree.
0052	2	Either got to prescribe an exorcism or admit to me that Smith was a horny fraud.
0322	1	Okay, bye. (He hangs up the phone.)
0131	1	Fine.
0955	1	I'm sorry, I don't own a TV.
0269	1	Liver, plus eye, plus kidney… most likely sclerosing cholangitis.
0734	1	(to Erin) Okay, good to see you again.
0279	1	Yeah, I think that'd be best... So, so I'm gonna... I'm gonna take off...
0613	1	You didn't answer question.
0477	1	(in a very aaaaahhhhh sweeeeeet voice) Aaahhh, look at you two... holding hands... huh is this getting serious? (Phoebe and Mike, embarrassed, start babbling and look away.) Have you not talked about it yet? (They say nothing now, but smile) Am I making you uncomfortable? (smiles are becoming forced now, and he speaks to Mike) If you were bigger you'd hit me, huh...? Aaaaaahhhhhh (he turns away to the bar)
0197	1	Come on, Raj.
0179	1	It was his idea. He saw the rash —
0327	1	This is it. Yeah, this is the one. I can't believe I found it!
0202	1	od. Hi.
0641	1	I'll draw cultures. Pneumonia; should be bacteria in his blood.
0402	1	Ankles. They buried the guy the wrong way around.
0961	1	Confusion. Delirium.
0292	1	What?!
0758	1	Yeah. Whining on someone's couch. That's an excellent use of my time. Maybe I'll discover that my childhood wasn't perfect.
0649	1	About what?
0453	1	I don't know. A place called Blue Barrel Kennels. They only had the thing for like, two days.
0080	1	Okay, so, here's the thing. I guess you're aware that Leonard asked me out.
0456	1	Nobody wants that.
0194	1	What?
0886	1	Mother's touch.
0659	1	So is cutting people with knives. But you can totally get away with that if you have a doctor coat on.
0536	1	How do you know about that story?!
0064	1	It's "Bolero" from "10".
0044	1	I said I'm busy, but that wasn't good enough for you!
0305	1	Ooh.
0854	1	Kevin, at most you're saving a microscopic amount of time.
0841	1	Oh, thanks man. Appreciate that.
0360	1	70? How many do you type?
0085	1	Is it? Just a moment ago I had a minor epiphany regarding the polymer degradation phenomenon while scraping congealed nachos off a plate. Bernadette, table 10 wants their check.
0930	1	Treatment's... fairly simple.
0283	1	Lung scarring along with the bad bone marrow points to an autoimmune disease. Could be pulmonary fibrosis.
0811	1	Sheldon, for God's sakes, don't make me beg.
0922	1	Oh I'm sorry, Jack's father is not available.
0153	2	Yeah, to the place where the doctor made her better. But before that, what about her arms and legs? Did she ever walk funny? Like sort of bent over?
0160	1	Heeeere's Dwi- what the-? Oh man.
0966	1	I discerned it.
0386	1	Help me open it.
0082	1	Uh-huh.
0189	2	To recoup their losses, I am planning a little charity auction, where people from all over Scranton can come and bid on our goods and services. I'm calling it crime-aid. It's like farm aid, but instead of farms fighting against AIDS, it is us fighting against our own poverty.
0677	1	Full term, and they gave her surfactant. Looks like they're fully developed.
0644	2	Yeah, right, there's nothing more awesome and frightening than a man who's got music blasting from between his nipples.
0746	1	Sheldon, I owe you an apology. Taking the train was a stroke of brilliance! I've actually got a shot at a Terminator.
0771	1	Yeah, gee, I'd really rather not.
0787	1	It's a little cramped. How many square feet out there? 17, 18 hundo?
0438	1	Yes.
0141	1	Listen, they're kind of getting busy in the living room, and I was wondering if I could hang out in here for a while.
0335	1	I don't know.
0373	1	Look, you've got to meet me halfway here.
0313	1	The laundry room. Sheldon, holding his laundry, is looking at the machines in dismay.
0287	1	Is that really necessary? Good Lord. The interference pattern in the fracture. The motion of the wave through the molecular structure. I've been looking at it all wrong. I can't consider the electrons as particles. They move through the graphene as a wave. It's a wave! The moment to applaud would be now. Troglodytes.
0777	1	is everything all right?
0212	1	Dad, what are you doing here?
0738	1	You can't do that.
0728	1	I think Miss Four Cavities' time would be better spent copying Mr. No Cavities instead of complaining about him. And given what I'd just been doing, I thought you wouldn't want me going out to dinner without a good brush and a floss.
0596	1	Then call your own mother. (To Leonard) It was Sheldon.
0408	1	s. Homelessness. What?
0254	1	Oh...how much?
0776	1	He's not having an affair!
0123	1	So you're gonna collect a hundred dollars and fire him because he has principles? [takes a bite out of the apple]
0116	1	Oh yeah. That's me.
0375	1	I never admitted to flushing anything. My prints make sense if I gave those tickets to you as an incentive to stay alive.
0572	1	Uh, radon?
0900	1	I had prison security check visitor logs, phone records. You've never had any contact with anyone at Fishkill. So, I ask again… What were you doing up in Middletown?
0451	1	Seriously?
0333	1	Don't! oh, you must think...I'm not. I'm using the fax, this isn't, no wait. I'm not supposed to represent the company. Right? There's usually an Erin here.
0845	1	New neighbour?
0589	1	Get in.
0271	1	I will be taking a morning walk and an afternoon walk. Would you like to join me?
0091	1	No.
0004	1	No. I think they were stolen. I think they were stolen and they're gone forever. So... oh, that was the last good item. So, good job, everybody.
0441	1	Tears seem appropriate. Enlargement of the heart muscle, or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, is a serious disease which could lead to congestive heart failure.
0120	1	I wasn't aware that lunar ranging was her thing. Although, I suppose the retro-reflector left on the moon by Neil Armstrong does qualify as a shiny object.
0046	1	l right.
0716	1	So much for the admiration.
0946	1	Dead men don't pee. Tox screen tests for metabolites in the urine. Coke never got past the lungs. Also explains the motorcycle crash. Idiots.
0672	1	(he enters) Hey guys!
0675	1	Brain biopsy revealed severe damage to the myelin sheath. Question is, why?
0650	1	You do if you want the job.
0142	1	Okay, don't be gross.
0820	1	Mike, you can't do that. It's conflict of interest.
0794	1	Okay. I—But I think we should still have this conversation.
0430	1	You.. fell asleep.
0902	1	Hey...OK no. No. That. You are so not...oh god. False. Andy, I will volunteer.
0684	1	No, no, please, come in. Yeah, I think you'll appreciate this, very exciting.
0071	1	Did you have a crush on me, when you first met me?
0937	1	Arctic? I thought you said Arkansas!
0814	1	Monica, that was also true an hour ago! I mean, please, look at you! Your hand is blistered, you can barely stand, your hair is inexplicable! Ok, you've already proven you are just as good as he is, now we've missed our dinner reservations, so now let's just go upstairs, order room service, take a shower and shave your head!
0819	1	I'mâ€¦ uhâ€¦ in aâ€¦ I'm in a radiation suit. What's up?
0792	1	It's French for good shower. It's a sentiment I can express in six languages.
0958	1	This looks like some serious stuff, Leonard, did you do this?
0293	2	, yeah, sitting on your big fat butt. Alright, that is the number to beat.
0214	1	The airport?
0331	1	It's time to go.
0889	1	No.
0603	1	You don't stay go straight when you're giving bearings, you say keep true.
0901	2	How can I go out with a woman who believes in psychics?
0836	1	I think I can sum it up with what I think is your favorite ice cream flavor....vanilla?
0088	1	Well, my stones are on the market.
0652	1	You know, you're starting to remind me of someone.
0429	1	Dude, I think you have appendicitis.
0203	4	I… admire lots of doctors. 'Course most of them look a lot better in knee socks than Ezra Powell, but seeing as they can all breathe.
0842	1	Good lord!
0543	1	s no worry.
0468	1	All right, pencils down! I have lokh, makh, and cherrrkh. Anybody got those?
0436	1	Howard, nice to meet you, and you are?
0940	1	Oh, maybe he was getting him confused with his childhood therapist.
0278	1	To be honest, I don't think Dr. Schaffer really gave me a chance.
0625	1	Increasing to 100% FiO2.
0282	1	Why don't you just buy the whole song?
0662	1	See-ka-tong-guay-jow.
0898	1	Okay, I think everybody just needs to relax.
0732	1	AM or PM?
0844	2	Draw some blood. (to Wilson, but not looking up from his phone) The self-important jerk does not have Transverse Myelitis. He's got cancer.
0033	1	I'm O Negative, universal donor.
0399	1	Oh.
0130	1	Hello.
0127	2	wow, the parade is really good this year. Man those horses can crap.
0342	1	I have no idea, I went to the bathroom. So sweetie, you were starting to tell me what is uh, what is new with you.
0442	1	She's mine!
0821	1	Stephanie Barnett is single.
0765	1	Attention Scranton Business Park, there will be complimentary pretzels in the lobby from now until 4 o'clock as a thank you to our loyal tenants.
0081	1	Okay.
0788	1	You are unbelievable.
0954	1	Gunther have you uh, have you seen Chandler?
0154	1	How is that not a braniac?
0507	1	Listen, she ignored my ultimatum. Now what?
0490	1	Unacceptable, the delay would result in tomorrow morning's bowel movement occurring at work.
0943	1	I'm going to close your left eye to keep it protected. I'm going to blink your eye a few times to distribute the dye. [She does and then looks at his eye through a lens.] Ulcerative keratitis.
0383	1	You can call the police. You can turn me in for lying at the accident.
0431	1	w many is that?
0607	1	(to Gunther) Excuse me, I'm looking for someone. You don't, by any chance, know a Ross Geller?
0465	1	Cookies. Bet you anything it's cookies.
0345	1	Yeah. And I said sorry.
0852	1	Mr. Weathers, I am sure you're right, but we need to be thorough. Did your son ever smoke marijuana?
0764	1	Charging… clear. Again… clear.
0463	1	If we want this not to get in the way of our friendship, I think we both have to apologize and put it behind us.
0503	1	I think stupid is our best-case scenario.
0162	1	I am not a reject.
0542	1	Hooters?
0017	1	Why not?
0550	1	Yeah, I just ordered a beer! (Pounds the table.)
0999	1	Thanks, Stuart. Let me ask you something. Do you think it's okay for Penny to have an ex-boyfriend sleep on her couch?
0775	1	125
0504	1	The application in your hand, give it to her.
0882	1	Oh, that would be a good way to go.
0458	1	Whoa, for like months?
0945	1	Any physical confrontation...
0626	1	What if you could? How 'bout we make a deal? Give me one more day. If I don't find out exactly what's wrong with you by then, I help you die.
0309	1	Anyway… seriously, uh…just…just talk to the guy, okay? And tell me how it goes. (walks towards the door until…)
0848	1	Okay.
0428	1	Look. Next to his fingernail.
0264	2	Oh, alright. I will give you my bed on one condition. That you promise to zip your hole for the next eight hours.
0364	1	No. No. Reservations are at 8:00, so we've got like an hour and 45 minutes. I'm a crazy eight, I'm crazy.
0055	1	Ezra Powell passed away last night. I’m sure you already knew about that.
0157	1	Hey, Charlie!
0939	1	(incredulous) I don't know what that's like?! Up until I was 25 I thought the only response to, "I love you," was, "Oh crap!"
0689	1	No, no, no, no, Orcs are magic, Superman is vulnerable to magic, not to mention, you already lost Godzilla to the Illinois Cavalry and Hulk.
0421	1	Oh my God!
0524	1	Wha- no. No, it was not a poisoning.
0755	1	You'll end up alone.
0398	1	Ah, then your meal choice is appropriate. Starch absorbs fluid which reduces the amount of vomit available for violent expulsion.
0547	1	I can tell from your expressions that that's the good news you were hoping for... Well, I'm gonna go continue to... spread the joy.(Chandler leaves the apartment. Joey sighs)
0887	1	You know, if you want it to mean you're crushing Wesley, it'd be the Wesley Crushers.
0723	1	You're extorting a date out of me?
0487	1	Nope. I'm good. I'm here. Let's find some warehouse workers.
0261	1	Michael! Hey! Over here, Michael!
0620	1	...Her liver failure is getting worse. You were right. Now what?
0539	1	I don't mean ask the patient, I mean ask her mother.
0514	1	So you're saying Leonard has a girl in there.
0533	1	Which one did you see?
0158	1	When you get up, I'm just going to take it back anyway, so...
0559	1	I'm dead, Wilson. How do you want to spend your last five months?
0506	1	Suddenly, you're not so fascinating. [He leaves.]
0368	1	He does want that. Does a man with my intellectual gifts play paintball on weekends?
0948	1	The apartment.
0574	2	Okay, even this is turning me on!
0936	1	Stop it. I'm blushing.
0077	2	Take a look at where you are, where you once worked in a dying industry, you now work at it's birth. Those superstores are terrified of us. Anybody know why?
0715	1	What, my fly open?
0648	1	OK.
0813	1	So I take it you don't want to help us trim the tree.
0724	1	He's always been like that.
0250	1	Anderson's three pillars of retail. Crucial. So important. Next. Are there any questions?
0021	1	Man.
0745	1	300, we have 300. 300 going once. 300 going twice.
0251	1	He died.
0095	1	Probably an abscess. If we find it with the ultrasound, we can drain it, make her better. You'll be able to take her home by the end of the week.
0104	1	No.
0343	1	Uh, no, thank you. Last time I went to the theater, a man dressed as a cat sat on my lap.
0252	1	Yeah?
0913	1	Yeah, right!
0633	1	We're heading out for some kite fighting.
0192	2	And a reasonable person would obviously consent to being put in a coma against their will just to satisfy your curiosity.
0671	1	Ice sculpture? That sounds really fancy! I told you I just want a simple wedding.
0043	1	Okay, a complete pass. First down, New England. I think I'm starting to get this.
0980	1	Oh, so we didn't win, but it's fun to play the game, right?
0683	1	It says "Lotto Pool", right on top.
0860	1	What's under the cloth?
0988	1	m tying a knot in the stem with my tongue.
0093	1	I won?
0459	1	We also need you to sign a health care proxy. If something goes wrong in surgery, someone needs to be appointed to make decisions for you.
0092	1	Honey, why did you get a loom?
0934	1	Yeah, I'm sure.
0736	1	Oh, good God.
0370	1	We probably shouldn't be turning up unannounced like this. Their son just died.
0253	1	We're gonna make everything all right. Alright? Conference room, 15 minutes. Half an hour. Alright?
0204	1	I'm wearing two belts.
0315	1	Yeah but y'know what they say Mon, "There's no such thing as bad press."
0611	1	Oh, yeah? Can you do this? (PerformsÂ  complex finger trick*) Nice working with you. I'm sorry, for you. (Exits. Sheldon stares a moment, then tries to perform the trick. Fails.)
0959	1	You think this is Oedipal?
0188	1	(He knocks at the door, Mike opens it) Hey Mike sorry to just drop by like this, can I come in?
0266	1	Hey, I have a question. Who do you think is really the best salesman in this office?
0365	1	You passed on all your cases, reassigned them to other doctors.
0873	1	Wrong. He's not afraid of anything. Also, I would have accepted snakes. Fear is what it's all about. You cannot sell while undergoing fear. You need to vanquish fear! One must wrestle fear to the ground. You will now wrestle my cousin Mose.
0637	1	What are the three pillars of retail?
0221	1	That just can't be right.
0257	1	So your attitude about therapy clearly hasn't changed. And yet you went. Which leads me to believe that maybe something else has changed. [The stop by the elevator.] Maybe you think you can change. Credit Cuddy with that.
0115	2	Well… That's not the only time this was an issue. You remember when umm, you spent Thanksgiving with us? You called me fat.
0467	1	Yeah...
0325	1	And you tell him that, then run back to your office while I get to deal with him. I left for a reason. That reason hasn't changed.
0066	1	Fine. But can't we go home and start this?
0995	1	Yeah. It's wonderful. Okay, maybe this whole living together happened kind of suddenly, but it's fine, it's great.
0409	1	Then why did you tell me you had it?
0321	1	That's a nice picture. Maybe you can still have that!
0401	1	Either way, he's dead. (House enters the lab) We can't stop the oozing.
0990	1	And if you didn't have a pathological need to create a close personal relationship with every dying person you meet, we would be blissfully ignorant of any ethical dilemmas and might actually be able to concentrate on the differential.
0328	1	Joe, I told you, you're just not right for the part.
0905	1	You've had cancer for a long time. It's never stopped you from bragging about the grandkids.
0011	1	And the worst sign of all is, you're here and not there.
0028	2	No, if you can talk to them, you can ask them out.
0598	1	Look I'm sorry, you violated the terms of your metaphor by acknowledging her existence. I'm out.
0964	1	We found rats in your buddy Dave's basement. Tested positive for leptospirosis. That means we're on the right treatment. So… try moving a finger. Your brain needs to get used to doing its job again. Try harder. I'm sure you've lost hope. I know we've told you several times that we knew what this was, but this time we're right. Concentrate. Move one finger for me. [Lee’s right forefinger moves. Kutner smiles and raises Lee’s hand so he can see his finger moving.] Welcome back.
0213	1	No sensation in the left leg, abdomen, right arm. Technology’s overrated.
0931	1	You're spying on your team.
0323	2	She killed a guy in a wheelchair. And his dog.
0489	1	You shut up! (To Phoebe and Rachel) I love arguing with her. (To Erin) I'll be right back.
0757	1	What can I do?
0618	1	Didn't drop a single ball!
0772	1	Dad, no. I'm just having a good time getting to know Andy's friends here.
0556	1	His dorm mates are computer science majors. If they're fabricating chips, they could be working with all kinds of different toxic solvents.
0753	1	You're wearing the same shirt.
0446	1	Hey, why don't you just go up to your office, get some work done, and I'll just bring you a pretzel.
0106	1	Can I see your license please?
