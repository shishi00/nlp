0802	1	Hey! Andy!
0793	1	Yeah, she's doing really well.
0859	1	Oh, time's up! Joey! You were, uh, almost on a roll there...
0612	1	Is that a relevant factor?
0047	1	Sorry, I forgot Kevin's extension. It's a fantasy football thing.
0883	3	If by eccentric you mean passive-aggressive East Texas blowhole, I agree.
0284	1	So walk home.
0469	1	You heard that, Ladies' Night ladies? We're eventually coming for you!
0977	1	Phyllis, I need you to pick up green streamers at lunch.
0660	1	The winner: under "Special Skills," Mr. Don Feiner put "Juggling."
0578	1	Bacterial infection?
0303	1	Puppet.
0828	1	Well, didn't you just hear what I said?!
0274	1	Maybe, but I'm guessing it will cost you about $500 an hour to try.
0084	1	Sorry I didn't show up in Middletown. I didn't get the message.
0580	1	Okay, maybe you didn't hear me, go away.
0230	1	Maybe.. we shouldn't be talking about this right now?
0805	1	Hello. Why do I smell methacrylate?
0585	1	I'm so sorry, I really thought if you guys went instead of me he wouldn't be such an ass.
0714	1	God help you.
0740	1	Bright side — they're probably up weeping. Hey, we both assaulted our bosses. It's like we're twins.
0911	1	Shouldn't we be entertaining our patient?
0118	1	Yeah, I'm sorry about that.
0350	1	Big step down from running your own business, to sweeping up.
0719	1	Rat pee. Very nice idea. Who came up with it?
0151	1	Oh, oh, I can do it for her, if you want...
0390	4	She's not my girlfriend. I'm just interested in her because she's a client, and she sleeps above her covers — four feet above her covers.
0075	1	The liver's fine. His enzymes have been normal since we admitted him.
0417	2	House was an ass. [That gets everyone’s attention.] He mocked anyone —patients, co-workers, his dwindling friends — anyone who didn't measure up to his insane ideals of integrity. He claimed to be on some heroic quest for truth, but the truth is, he was a bitter jerk who liked making people miserable. And he proved that by dying selfishly, numbed by narcotics, without a thought of anyone. A betrayal of everyone who cared about him
0041	1	Well, there's a lot of gray area in that clause. Do you want to re-mediate?
0725	1	... when are you coming in for that free lunch? You're gonna want to come in on a day that I'm working. Uh, maybe I can hear more about that book, too.
0685	1	No, you didn't. You said Leonard's experiment was stupid.
0801	1	All right, let's go.
0594	1	Right. Um, well how 'bout we take a look at some applications? ...This guy wrote his in green ink, that's pretty cool. Check it out. Hey! There ya go...there he is.
0669	1	The apartment, the living room.
0501	1	Right, it feels strange.
0619	1	The laundry room.
0657	1	That is so awesome.
0299	1	Let’s start him on high dose penicillin G.
0766	2	Nope. His son is dead. The only way that has any meaning is if we fix the lungs and transplant them. It doesn’t matter how much we piss him off as long as we find something. So go back there, piss him off and find something.
0349	1	Let's say that I go out and I spend fifty dollars on you, it's a laborious activity, because I have to imagine what you need, whereas you know what you need. Now I can simplify things, just give you the fifty dollars directly and, you could give me fifty dollars on my birthday, and so on until one of us dies leaving the other one old and fifty dollars richer. And I ask you, is it worth it?
0347	2	Do you realise I may have to share a Nobel Prize with your booty call?
0377	1	Sheldon, what the hell are you doing?
0779	1	Really? Okay. Retail consumer habits is... The only thing you need to know about retail consumer habits is that consumers are mindless lemmings. They just want to be told what to do. Fast forward to today, and the retail consumer is independent, well-informed, super smart. Super smart. Okay.
0741	1	Is there a third option?
0810	1	Huh. Okay, Mr. Perkazet.
0923	1	Well, House has got 100 bucks on cancer. So unless you want in
0275	1	Because there's a problem. No organ donor card. Dead guy's sister is next of kin. She's refusing to allow the donation.
0960	1	Oh, you guys! We've got to keep all the tickets together (takes the bowl from Ross and puts it on the table)
0899	1	do you have any cake?
0171	1	Andy, sing us another song.
0174	1	We're home.
0137	1	If she doesn't like it, she doesn't like it. Apparently, I suck at picking out jewelry, but least have the guts to tell me.
0087	1	You can either satisfy your curiousity, or remain ignorant, do nothing ethically wrong and my patient doesn't die in three hours.
0042	1	I would also like to toast Robert California. Mr. California,...
0067	1	The university cafeteria. The guys have shaved and had haircuts. Howard has kept his moustache.
0241	1	I saw your extension on the call. What are you doing down here?
0546	1	It's not the greatest one either...
0969	1	Thank you! I had just gone to the beach that weekend.
0548	1	Like Wilson did. You accepted his choice — that ending the pain was better than the pain. Why can't you give yourself that gift?
0784	1	And what would that be?
0561	1	[looks at Taub] No. It means we were wrong. [pause] It's a melanoma.
0987	1	Your only secrets are the girls you find embarrassing. And the only embarrassing girl you've met recently is the one at your brother's cuckoo facility.
0099	1	These would have been your seats. Best seats in the house. Lots of people think it would be the front row, but actually, right here, this is where the speakers converge, and the sound just, like, nails you right here.
0971	1	Oh I feel very lucky, she's great. I think she's the most beautiful woman I've ever seen.
0219	2	You know, maybe we should just have our own pregnancies and not pretend like we're in this together.
0440	2	(looking at Mike) Oh, yeah! (turning to Chandler) Are you telling me you... you're not even... a little turned on by Monica, right now?
0348	1	Compwetely wecked.
0139	2	Oh, it's all right, I do. Oh! You're in for what my mother calls a real Eye-talian treat. (Enters apartment).
0577	1	(a little freaked out) So! Umm, anyway I-I lived in New York, someone wildly I guess, for umm—Well since I was fourteen.
0336	1	Look, friends don't diagnose friends with cancer. I get it. Your problem is you're not objective. Your caring is clouding your diagnosis. Just cut that out and you could be a pretty decent doctor.
0941	1	Okay, (gets up) if you'll excuse me, I-I'm gonna go hang out with some people who don't know the Space Mountain story.
0161	1	You're not going to score any points with House by kissing my ass.
0749	3	So what do we do? We put a plastic bag over his head and get it over with?
0289	1	It's not that big a deal. You just go down to the court on Thursday and you pay the fine.
0412	1	I apologize. He's only an experimental physicist.
0627	1	Hello.
0334	1	Excellent deduction.
0891	1	All right, let's see how many more turkeys we can miss.
0909	1	You know what? Instead of a game, why don't we do an exhibition? I'd love to see that dunk of yours.
0824	1	A Christmas drinking game ...
0926	1	You said one of us wasn't a doctor, and you called him a fraud.
0979	1	Oh, that's right I remember now, I stole it. Because if you had gone up there to check out my girlfriend, you wouldn't have come back here and lied to me about it. You would've thrown her right in my face.
0682	1	You brought your husband to work, you know the rules. Meesa thinking yousa looking pretty sad now too, betcha, betcha.
0107	1	Sleep is an active process. Reboots the system, restores the brain, sedatives don't
0505	2	Humpf, remember him? How we used to make out all the time after you went to sleep.
0199	1	Let's ink...my stink!
0967	1	Yes dear.
0978	1	You do realize it's just a metaphorical trap? You'll still have all your limbs. [Taub shows mock-relief.] Fourth rib about the midclavicular line. You're over-thinking this. House fired my pick sight-unseen. He was never even interested in Chase's pick, he was only obsessed with how she reflected on Chase. Dr. Cheng is the only candidate he's actually responded to. You wanted House invested. He is. Hire her.
0588	2	No-no it's not! I don't want to lose you! It's-it's like I was saying to Ursula when I was making love to her and I thought she was you—Yeah it is too weird.
0832	1	Oh my god, are we supposed to answer?
0102	1	I figured House might go back to the pills, but if he's using his cane he's right back to where he was before. Maybe even worse.
0356	1	Nothing?
0206	1	Then we'll wake you back up. We need you to answer some simple yes or no questions while we're cutting, to make sure we're not cutting anything…
0388	1	She called me dumbass.
0704	2	This is the 21st century, Wilson. I realize that the logical course of any adult relationship could one day lead to fornication. Although, the fact that she wants to buy a loft, could actually mean that their relationship is not as serious as I thought.
0522	1	Actually, science is my lady.
0638	1	Oh no, I don't believe in Western medicine. No, if you just apply pressure to these points right here. (She's pinching the bit of skin between her right thumb and forefinger with her left hand.) Then your hand starts to hurt and you still have a headache, so thanks. (Takes the pills.)
0176	1	Wait! I just want you to know that... I'm so happy you're going to be here.
0472	1	Obviously, obviously you had a plan. The more interesting question is why you didn't tell the team. I think it's because part of you knew from the start that the plan wouldn't work.
0827	1	It's a pretty cool tux.
0223	1	Why not?
0605	1	Why not? What are you doing?
0039	1	People have got to finish their stories!
0833	1	Yeah. It's actually our first official date
0009	1	Yeah. He thinks I betrayed him. I mean, come on, what would you guys do if you were me?
0134	2	Okay, oh, and Emma needs a cowgirl outfit for the competition.
0259	1	(jumping up and removing the bandages) I'm back baby! Ha-ha-ha!
0579	1	Yeah!
0935	1	Okay.
0163	1	I-
0770	1	(very excited) Oh! Great! So how much does it pay? (Ross just gives up and leaves)
0318	1	He's fine.
0079	1	That's Will from high school!
0834	1	Nice. I'm in the common bile duct.
0314	1	OK what?
0049	1	Is it?
0218	1	Well, it seems that the newcomer approaches the existing group with the greeting â€œHow wasted am I?â€ which is met with an approving chorus of â€œDude.â€
0129	1	Homesick is a type of being sick.
0306	1	Can I inspire? I don't know!.....I don't know.
0061	1	And I said you could study me 'cause I'm a tiny living thing. It's a joke.
0921	1	llo, how are you?
0647	1	Listen. I've got a sixer. "Automatic for the People" on the jukebox. Let's hit the park after sundown. Come on! Pick up some sausage if you want.
0846	1	Hey. Can a guy get a little privacy?
0329	1	Okay. Alright, bye Cece.
0590	1	How many words per minute does the average person type?
0692	1	No. I just got in.
0405	1	Oh, well sure. This gotta be so hard. I'll do it. Gimme!
0963	1	You have amyloidosis; it’s in your lungs, kidneys, bone marrow, and brain.
0665	1	Isolating the common bile duct.
0537	1	Oh no, I'm serious. I was thinking, "For this trip I have to do something epic, so what should that be?" and then I thought of it. I'll poison you. What are you gonna do? You gonna steal my newspaper or put a cricket in my cereal or something?
0229	1	Yeah?
0462	1	These nuts are really hard to crack.
0529	1	Oh great! Y'know I would've been perfect for this part, but whatever! Y'know, thanks for making a bad decision and ruining your movie! Good day! (Starts to leave.)
0712	1	Use the people already on the case.
0646	1	Carol had a mustache?
0226	1	Can I introduce you around now?
0558	1	Like a month ago.
0831	1	Why, you did, sir. You. Dr. Sheldon Cooper, and may I add, it is a privilege to know you.
0695	1	Yeah?
0519	1	Uh, a choo-choo train?
0722	1	Wilson is dying. Your parole officer is probably on his way here right now. How are you possibly in a good mood?
0972	1	Multi-colored robes! Ooh, and maybe a hat.
0165	1	Let's go-oh-oh Ou-oooo-ut tonight. I have to go-oh-oh-oh ou-ooooo-ut tonight.
0737	1	Oh, my goodness, look at this room! Champagne! Roses! Oh, and little chocolates! This is going to be the best Valentine's Day ever.
0037	1	You are really good! I play a little guitar myself.
0150	1	It's a reference to Citizen Kane. Something that explains why a person became the way they are.
0407	1	Um, loneliness. Maybe women.
0019	2	No, write another article. Kick ass until you're sitting behind some big expensive desk and someone from Johns Hopkins calls and says 'We're thinking about hiring Eric Foreman as our head of Neurology'. And you can say whatever you want.
0231	1	Your mommy says no, 'cause she's mean. [shrugs] If it was up to me...
0022	1	What?
0443	1	(pauses, then crunches up the note and stuffs it in his pocket.) Never mind.
0621	1	Oh. (She goes into the bathroom.) What's wrong?
0985	1	Chick and the duck? Didn't they die...
0523	1	We came to apologize.
0748	1	Can't. Mercy fired him.
0260	1	No. We have a slightly more humane delivery system. But we do have to open you up. It is surgery. And like any operation, there are risks.
0112	1	How about you drop it in your office?
0265	1	Besides, I can't leave until their Christmas party downstairs clears out; there are some *pissed off* insurance people looking for that ham.
0193	2	The problem with having "It" or "the X-factor" or whatever it is you want to call it, is that it's impossible to put into words what you're bringing to the table. So to make things simpler for Deangelo, I just, without lying, strongly implied that I'm Kelly's supervisor. It's not even that much of a stretch. She pretty much does whatever I say.
0432	1	That's right, yeah.
0352	1	Why did I fire you again?
0396	1	(yawning) Oh, that's great.
0320	1	He really needs to dial it down.
0025	1	There's no time for a crossbow. Find me an icicle.
0117	1	Guess we found Andy's rosebud.
0486	1	Oh that's nice.
0509	1	Hi Howard.
0330	1	Don't you dare, missy.
0892	1	Well, I wasn't listening, then.
0466	4	Totally. I mean, I'd never bang an animal, you can hardly tell the difference between a boy or a girl, you know, but hunting's intense.
0302	1	Morning.
0920	1	oa.
0664	1	Although... it's also about the wedding... Ugh, alright... here. (she gives the check and pulls it back again) No... Oh God... Oh!
0280	1	I don't have a few minutes, I'm running really late.
0673	1	(turning a corner) There he is!!
0862	1	The comic book store.
0950	1	Oh and you know what, it will be even better tomorrow, because I won't be constantly interrupted by Joey checking to see if they put chocolates on my pillow yet. (Someone knocks on the door, Ross goes to open and it's Joey, Rachel and Chandler).
0800	1	Fank-u.
0164	1	Not if he wants a Nobel Prize.
0172	1	Yes, I can read the sign, I'm just pondering the implications.
0072	1	It's hard for some people!
0298	1	Permission denied.
0851	1	No, no, no. Don't do that! I want you to look her in the eyes, and tell her the truth.
0190	1	, hey, I invited my friend Julie.
0640	1	Joey, would you just come out here and stop being such a baby!
0113	1	You don't owe me anything.
0847	1	Yeah, where were you!
0256	3	Well played. Religion just killed another person.
0288	1	E-e-excuse me?
0774	1	I feel terrible.
0773	1	Well that's a delightful little story, but our arrangement was that you sit here and not say anything, I answer the questions.
0015	1	You know what? I am ending this. Penny didn't want to hold the ring anymore. She gave it to me, I have it. I'm sending it back. Where's the ring?
0464	1	You had no right to invade my privacy. [He reaches under Lee’s pillow and pulls out a recorder.]
0018	1	Wow! Aren't you gonna be cold?
0086	1	I'm busy.
0073	1	There are no do-overs in Wii bowling.
0690	1	Here, here!
0034	1	One.
0994	1	And that's the kind of sloppy costuming which results from a lack of rules and competition.
