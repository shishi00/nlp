0565	1	Yes.
0094	1	Pull the needle out.
0186	1	You must be Ben's mum.
0599	1	In brightest day, in darkest night, no evil shall escape my sight.
0564	3	Ah, I need my entourage Jim. Dwight. Ryan. C'mon, we're going to Asian Hooters.
0182	1	Hey! Look I brought a friend for dinner, this is Zack, from work!
0651	1	Excuse me? He doesn't even know what he's doing!
0236	1	Hey, hey, hey! You are not gonna pin this on me! [he opens the screen on Rachel's window] Rachel needs to be monitored for 24 hours to see that the dime passes. [he swings one leg out the window] You know, just to make sure she doesn't die.
0029	1	So, except for the fermentation process, beer and ale are basically the same thing. Fascinating isn't it.
0615	1	I'm the Holiday Armadillo, your part-Jewish friend. You sent me here to give Ben some presents. Remember?
0470	1	Outsourcing and consolidation of competition.
0340	2	How dare you. Aishwarya Rai is a Goddess. By comparison Madhuri Dixit is a leprous prostitute.
0628	1	People are found sometimes, even in… collapsed—
0806	1	(excited and simultaneously as Chandler) Hungry monkey! (To Chandler) Haaa! (To Joey) I'd like a Wicked Wango card!
0639	1	I feel like there's a chance for me to start over. And if I fall back into the same kind of things I used to do., then ... what am I doing?
0554	1	You're welcome. One more thing.
0552	1	Great nap.
0002	1	I just don't get it.
0355	1	Oh, look at this. Your old condo closing papers. It's riddled with Carol's name. I wish I could throw this in the box.
0897	1	There he is! Got ya coffee.
0366	1	A friend's house?
0497	1	Maybe. So this is the living room huh? Ooh, it's pretty dark. (starts feeling around him like he's in a completely dark room, touching Chandler, who backs out and hits him)
0424	1	Hi.
0517	1	Come on, Dwight.
0857	1	That cold sore is caused by a virus. Assuming you guys kiss, the virus could transfer, infect your spine, and cause the paralysis. It's a disease called Transverse Myelitis.
0568	1	Doesn't seem to have the thick walls you'd expect from an abscess.
0584	1	Carol.
0374	1	(to Rachel) Thank you so much for this.
0493	1	I assume you're hanging around because you want a job.
0058	1	...sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle;and away they all flew like the down of a thistle; but I heard him exclaim, ere he drove out of sight, "Merry Christmas to all, and to all a goodnight!"
0437	1	Uh, you know what, I can go park it myself.
0211	1	No, he's a freak.
0575	1	I like it, that's the point. I'd rather have it at home in the jewelry box than getting peed on at work.
0797	1	Wait....they're terrified?
0532	1	Oh, okay.
0133	1	What?
0829	1	Clearly, something's going on in mom's blood that's treating her melanoma as well as her baby's.
0525	1	At least I didn't have to invent twenty-six dimensions just to make the math come out.
0759	1	I mean, my mom could've just said, â€œBob, get over it, she's a girl, move on.â€ But she didn't. Not one word.
0803	1	Dahaaa! (Punches Chandler in the arm and he makes a face of pain.) I'm going to find the men's room, be right back.
0393	1	How can you say that?! The Mets have no closer!
0006	1	Yeah. That makes sense. OK. Good, alright.
0747	1	I got it. I'm doin' it.
0624	3	I am not going to bargain babysitting for sex. [is distracted by said cleavage] Who the hell said that? Of course I will.
0855	1	I don't know.
0676	1	Hey. Here's the thing. Jo saw something in you. She loved you! She gave you a shot and then you stopped pushing. She noticed.
0276	1	Oh, absolutely. That makes sense. The dog was in here getting his eyes checked and forgot to put his jewelry back on.
0938	1	Brain computer interface… better known as BCI. The goal is to get you to move that cursor with your mind. When you think "up" the computer records the pattern. Think "up" enough times, it eventually learns what you're thinking. So… start thinking "up."
0362	1	All right. (She takes the phone from Rachel.) Hello? Hi. I'm sorry about her, but she wasn't wrong about the dirty stuff.
0592	1	She has two cancers?
0353	1	Oh, this is ridiculous. What?
0527	1	See you later.
0415	1	Camouflaging bald spots. That's primarily a male concern. Perhaps we could expand our market.
0238	1	Sure.
0893	1	So what's the final head count on my baby shower?
0553	1	The rings don't have to be there if there's neurological symptoms
0205	1	Oscar, it's not that hot out.
0790	1	What are you doing? What did you give him?
0013	4	Don't worry, it's treatable. Being a bitch though, nothing we can do about that.
0233	2	Yeah. I was out marinating my liver in alcohol to get it ready for the transplant. Yeah.
0515	1	We have a crisis. Which, is good news for you. You're out tonight on conditional parole. The condition being that you're employed by me, at PPTH.
0173	1	Who cares, it got you here.
0175	1	y, Michael, where have you been?
0663	1	Uh, actually, that's..
0404	1	You don't need a reason to throw a garden party anymore than you need a reason to throw a birthday party. It's a garden party. You don't need a reason.
0593	1	You hand-wrote it?
0608	1	Hello Rachel, you uh, got a minute?
0630	1	I'd like to make a toast to the troops. All the troops. Both sides.
0869	1	It's too murky. I like Ryan. You seem kind of hysterical to me. Ryan's your supervisor. Let's just leave it that way.
0721	1	To what end?
0316	1	Or you could use the LP for something useful. If you find polys, it's varicella. Lymphs, Behcet's.
0045	1	Wow. What have we got here?
0481	1	You didn't notice that I was wearing it?
0031	2	Boring. Since the baby has the melanoma, we kind of already knew the mom had it.
0751	1	Sleeping with somebody new, anxiety, panic, and I'm afraid even more sweating.
0502	2	That woman in there's not going to have sex with you.
0380	1	MRI didn't indicate any cerebral ischemia.
0906	1	I'm doing this to be a good neighbour. In any case, there's no way it could lower the odds.
0861	1	Taking a sample of the bile duct.
0534	2	Guess we’ve figured out why you're seeing me; your suicidal friend.
0168	1	Round two. Did Justine go home? [Abbey gets up from her chair]
0798	1	No. I came here to defeat Wil Wheaton, the man who destroyed my dreams. But I can't defeat Wil Wheaton, the man who loved his mee-maw. Enchanted bunny.
0111	1	I had to get your attention. This is an emergency.
0521	1	The nurse charted at 2 AM; he was stable. Breathing labored, but regular. And at 2:30 he suddenly stopped.
0680	1	Pheebs is your grandmother maybe saying that you should live here alone?
0450	1	(over-enthusiastic) I don't know, I don' I don' know! I was just trying to get into a young mindset, you know, and it just started to flow.
0089	2	When you weren't in St. Louis for two days, I assume you were getting some strange for two days.
0384	1	Yeah. There's a lot of blood in here. Sponge.
0756	1	Why would we take the dog?
0691	1	Well, I just think we all deserve to be with someone who wants to be with us.
0795	1	Yup, looks like the Scranton people and the Stamford people are finally coming together. And that's what you want, right?
0720	1	How is that my fault?
0562	1	He injected newborn babies with radioactive agents just to see if they had urethral reflux.
0376	1	Mr. Todd! Mr. Todd! I found her!
0178	1	Hey, what do you say we celebrate? Champagne? (he goes to get the champagne)
0681	1	Are you really admitting defeat?
0425	1	Donor six traveled to Thailand around Khorat. Region was endemic with dengue fever.
0414	1	That sounds like fun.
0817	1	Well, neither.
0762	1	sure.
0249	1	It's a dime!
0492	1	It's my dad and my brother. I would have joined in but this melody doesn't really support another harmony part, so... Check it out, that's my brother's boss. Look how psyched he is, he's having an awesome time.
0036	1	I mean, do you like it? You having fun? Tell you this, everybody else is having a lot of fun....and you did that.
0874	1	Oh, hey, Penny. Wow. Hi.
0604	1	Well I have to. Okay? If I don't, they'll take the class away from me. And…I already put it in my family newsletter.
0403	1	No it’s about whether you die or we murder you.
0518	1	Uh, middle balcony.
0867	1	The infection destroyed your liver, which released toxins that caused the locked-in syndrome. You were dying of a paper cut.
0512	1	Let me tell you how I buy something these days. I know what I want I go on the internet, I get the best price. Or I don't know what I want and I go to a small store that can help me. The era of personal service is back. You are back. You'll find that customers will pay our higher prices and then they will thank us, and we will say to them "you are welcome." Andrew, I chose you for a reason. Lead these people. Show me the best numbers this place has ever seen. Last quarter we saw 4% growth. Double it.
0904	1	I don't know. All I know is that I'm gonna need to work late. I was actually hoping that you could baby-sit.
0602	1	Not together!
0291	1	10 seconds, you need this or you lose the game.
0311	2	No, see the thing is I want to get out of here before Joey gets all worked up and starts calling everybody bitch.
0195	1	OK, alright, that's...look. All we were trying to do is we thought we could come up with a more efficient way to do things.
0687	1	No.
0850	1	I know! Monica's gonna have a baby! Hey, can this count as her something new?
0520	1	Maybe. He was more analytical about the diagnostic procedures. She concentrated more on the ethical dilemmas of informed consent. How any patient can really be informed without a medical degree.
0953	1	stop.
0513	1	Thank you for coming by. (He rises from his desk. Everyone rushes to look nonchalant.) Hello.
0729	1	You forbid it?
0970	1	No, I didn't. So either I have a hole in my pocket —
0918	1	Yeah!
0341	1	Uh, I know! It's been a while!
0761	1	I was going to do that.
0124	2	I'm gonna set your face on fire.
0304	1	Thank you.
0881	4	Right. We're both victims. A simple heads up, that's all I needed. You know, between your incredibly witty remarks about anal sex and Cuddy's breasts, you could have tipped me off.
0742	1	Kevin, do you feel OK?
0645	1	Shh-shh-shh!
0191	1	You applied for the job. You asked me to call and recommend you.
0103	1	It's okay, I want this to be your night too. (Raises his class.) To Monica.
0658	1	And that doesn't scare you? (He walks out)
0570	1	Okay, I'm not talking about this with you.
0858	1	Have you read it? Has an adult member of your family read this particular issue?
0427	1	Okay, I've found the perfect solution. We get off the train at the next stop in Oxnard. We then take the 1:13 train back to Union Station. We take a cab back to the apartment, get my flash drive, and then race to San Luis Obispo, where, assuming the lights are with us and minimal traffic, we'll meet the train.
0962	1	I won't lie, it's pretty dope.
0297	3	Well, I guess it would be nice, if I could touch your body, I know not everybody has got a body like you. Baaby.
0471	1	Ryan, come on. I am sorry. I am sorry. Mose is sorry too. Look, he sent over a basket with eggs and some fat back bacon. And look, something he whittled.
0991	1	We think Chandler might be having an affair.
0225	2	Well, look - it's not my fault if you're too uptight to appreciate the male form in all it's glory.
0694	1	I'll get my chisel.
0237	1	Oh, give me! (opens the box happily, then gets freaked and throws away the box, she and Mon jump up the sofa)
0354	1	I can't believe I didn't think of toasting Robert. Get in the game, Gabriel! Why are you talking to Stanley's mistress?
0239	1	Alright, lady, now give me your purse!
0567	1	Well now what's the rush?
0992	1	 I like you. Really. We have a good time working together. But ten years from now, we're not going to be hanging out and having dinners. Maybe we'll exchange Christmas cards, say hi, give a hug if we're at the same convention. [sighs] We're not friends. We're colleagues. And I don't have anything to apologize for.
0449	1	, no, no. Blah blah blah blah!
0996	1	So if Monica's not around, then I'm not good enough to raise Emma?
0228	1	Pheebs! (He looks down as he goes down the step to make sure he didn't fall again.) Check it out! (He starts laughing when he realized what he did.)
0541	1	You have unlimited texting. Until your parents know, you will never see that punch for what it really was. Your February 4th. Sri Lankan Independence Day.
0982	1	Wait, you can't go away this weekend! It's Emma's birthday!
0744	1	Yes?
0433	1	It's a day to be thankful.
0222	1	You wanna know how she knew him? (He points at Phoebe) Because Phoebe used to mug people.
0703	1	Keys, keys...
0391	1	Well, a little bird told me that you and Lesley hooked up last night.
0903	1	I really do.
0010	2	You're... weird!
0555	1	It'd help if you weren't drinking light beer.
0666	1	Hi, hey. I'm running out to the market, do you guys need anything?
0027	2	I'll be on top. It's the most important position.
0023	1	Oh, no, it does. It does. It has to be winter, and I reject it. So I drew up a design concept. Probably gonna be rubbish, right? Would you like to look at it? Just so you could laugh at it.
0032	1	You're just misappropriating my understanding.
0326	1	So bad.
0924	1	Because uh, Friday, we are attending a symposium on molecular positronium.
0105	1	You can open your eyes now.
0606	1	Hey.
0235	1	No, it's pretty well imprinted on my brain. Especially the whole rodeo thing.
0997	1	Yeah, that's all-inclusive.
0739	1	For what?
0273	1	Won't be fast enough. Wilson needs these lungs.
0457	1	That could really be fun.
0713	1	Dear Lord!!
0003	1	ah!
0786	1	(angrily) Look, if you did...
0781	1	Who's doing the presentations?
0623	1	Laser demonstration's looking pretty good now, huh?
0444	1	Felony vandalism should have added another year or two to your sentence. It's a miracle the parole board agreed to six months.
0400	1	So...
0856	1	Way to get right back on that horse, "Thirteen".
0915	1	No gall stones. Could be Diverticulitis. (to the patient) Have you eaten any seeds?
0030	1	Missy?
0500	1	If you don't like it, it's fine. It's not a big deal.
0097	1	I was talking to myself.
0215	1	Honey, you're screaming.
0808	1	Well, yeah, when you start a party at seven, no-one shows up at, you know, seven.
0389	1	Six if you count Klingon.
0668	1	Yeah, and I never wanted to kick Albert Einstein in the nuts. You know, I gotta ask, why didn't you just get a license at 16 like everybody else?
0484	3	What's the hiring policy over there? All ass based?
0461	1	Sure. That won't raise any suspicions.
0780	1	d, are we having fun?
0508	1	You'd better hope not because I just read what you put on your page today.
0121	1	Is this the best way to use one of your three magic wishes?
0262	1	…your chest, sort of in the fetal position.
0065	1	It's cold.
0783	1	I can see that. Unless you're planning on running a marathon, choosing both stuffing and mashed potatoes is a starch filled redundancy.
0822	1	Hmm, mild discomfort. So I take it you've had one of these Braxton thingies?
0868	3	Oh, come on. He's old, and sick, and tiny. We can do whatever we want to him.
0583	1	She told a friend. The friend let it slip.
0138	1	u know what we haven't done in a while? Happy hour. Upstairs, the warehouse, everybody just going out for a drink.
